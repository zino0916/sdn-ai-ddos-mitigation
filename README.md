# SDN-based DDoS Mitigation using AI-driven Traffic Analysis

## Overview
This project investigates the feasibility of
integrating AI-based traffic analysis
with Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
to enable flexible DDoS mitigation.

The key idea is to separate
lightweight traffic inference
from centralized model training.

## Core Idea
- Traffic statistics are collected from SDN switches
- An AI model analyzes traffic patterns
- The SDN controller dynamically applies
  allow or drop policies based on the analysis

## Current Status
This repository currently provides
a proof-of-concept design and documentation.
Implementation and experiments
will be added step by step.

## Design Focus
- Architectural flexibility
- Real-time policy enforcement
- Scalability considerations

## Notes
Model accuracy is not the primary objective.
The emphasis is on validating
the overall control and decision flow.
